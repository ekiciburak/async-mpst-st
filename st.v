Inductive sort: Type :=

Inductive subsort: sort -> sort -> Prop :=
  | sni  : subsort snat sint
  | srefl: forall s, subsort s s.

Notation "p '&' l" := (st_receive p l) (at level 50, left associativity).
Notation "p '!' l" := (st_send p l) (at level 50, left associativity).

Definition st_id (s: st): st :=
  match s with
    | st_end         => st_end

Lemma st_eq: forall s, s = st_id s.
Proof. intro s; destruct s; easy. Defined.
